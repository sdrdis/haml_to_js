haml_to_js is a ruby library and command line that converts haml to javascript.

Why an other haml to js converter (see similar utilities) ?
* It is a extension of [haml_to_star](https://github.com/sdrdis/haml_to_star) which purpose is to convert haml into any language
* This converter is intended for front usage
* It simplifies debugging (the generated code is readable, a variable hold haml line number so you can know exactly where the problem is)
* It support features that other don't support (don't hesitate to raise an issue if I am no longer right):
  * if...else statements
  * Declarations such as `.first{class: 'second'}` will generate `<div class="first second"></div>`
  * Support for brackets inside parameters (ex: `%div{key: 'value with bracket}'}`)
